        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h>
      </div>
        <p>
          1. I set unrealistic expectations for myself. It hurts to not know how to do something, especially when you’re seeing other people doing it, or you feel you’ve been doing it long enough so you believe you should be capable by now.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. I can be too stubborn or independent. I spend too long struggling before asking for help or sometimes even just googling the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. I think I’ve been at least partially stuck in the wrong mindset. I need to focus more on growth which loops back around to the first point.

        <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          Values: Our values keep us honest and fair with ourselves and others. This impacts our learning as we push ourselves to work and support not only ourselves but also those around us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy: This helps us to better understand and connect with the material as we are able to see it through others perspectives. This cements our knowledge and gives us a range of viewpoints to consider what we are learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-awareness: The better able we are to understand ourselves, the easier it becomes to identify and solve our flaws. This is key for not only working on those areas that need improvement but also being okay with the fact we may be at different stages in our learning.

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          Just how useful it is. In the 5 weeks we’ve been learning I think I can already see the impact it has had on my technical learning and ability to connect with others. I think this type of learning is not often talked about or taught, but it is hugely valuable.

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          The self reflection involved in many of the tasks. It’s not often that I would willingly choose to ‘review’ myself but I think it’s a key part in identifying faults and flaws, so that you are able to work on them. It’s also nice to be able to identify the good aspects which I think I would usually overlook when doing self reflection.

        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          I think it’s a valuable or ‘standout’ point for employers. Being able to improve yourself 	and also work in a team are invaluable skills that workplaces will look for. People do 
	        better work when working with people they like, as opposed to people with a lot of 	knowledge.

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer:</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          It never felt like a waste of time. Working on those core skills affects not only your work in a team, but also your programing technical aspects. It is an all-round good skill to have, affecting time-management, team-work, feedback, etc. These are all skills necessary for you to be an effective programmer and good team-member.
