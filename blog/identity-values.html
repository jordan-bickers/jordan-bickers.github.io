      <li id="li-iv">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. 
      Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now:</li>
      <p id="iv">-My work was selling burgers marketed as vegetarian, but they were cooked along side the meat products. During this period if I served a customer I would tell them that although there was no meat in the burger, it was cooked next to meat products/in the same vat as meat products, and allowed them to make their own decision if they still wanted to order it or not. I knew this would probably get me in trouble with the higher-ups but felt I had to inform the customers so they could decide for themselves if they were okay with it. I would say the values that came into play were, Fairness, Honesty, Kindness. Looking back, I don't regret this decision. I think those customers deserved to make an informed decision and the company should be open about how the food is prepared.</p>
      
      <li id="li-iv">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity:</li>
      <p id="iv">-I noticed that while at work, the people who surrounded me would directly influence my attitude and could for a time both negatively or positively influence my values, but didn't influence any permanent changes. Those more permanent aspects of my personality definitely come from the people who I hang out with in my free time, and my family. I'm fairly lucky to have a family and friends that really support me and have been able to help me to develop positive values. I mostly attribute my identity to my awesome friends who give me space to develop as a person.</p>
      
      <li id="li-iv">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey:</li>
      <p id="iv">-I think my strongest strength lies in my curiosity. Curiosity is obviously so important when starting a new journey, such as learnining to code. This keeps me wanting to
      explore more, and keeps me focused on getting as much out of the course as possible. I also like to think of myself as a team player and good collaborator, which in a course like this with a lot of peer work, should be invaluable. My last key strength would be problem-solving. I think I have the ability to step-back from a project and look at it from multiple angles to fix whatever issue I encounter.</p>
      
      <li id="li-iv">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?:</li>
      <p id="iv">-My time management can be pretty poor. I sometimes have periods of extreme procrastination and can find it hard to get back into the 'groove' of things. Although with tools like toggl, and taking breaks when I feel my concentration slipping, I believe I can stay on track to finish things on time. I also get nervous speaking to new people/groups. This will improve the longer I know the people, and I'm improving this overall by trying to force myself to be more out-going.</p>
      
      <li id="li-iv">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
      Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why:</li>
      <p id="iv">-Closing shift at work. (We would pull apart the store and clean everything). Me and a co-worker had a difference of opinion about how something should be done and how a new crew member was being trained. I ended up realising that arguing about it then and there, wasn't going to achieve anything and would just set us back, so resolved to re-visit it later. This way I could speak to a higher member of staff and have them weigh in and resolve it in a way that didn't create more conflict. I think if I were to do it again, I would try to be more supportive in the way I voiced my concerns and not push the point if they were unwilling to have a discussion.</p>
