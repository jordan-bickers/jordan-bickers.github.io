      <!-- Analogy for JS relationship with HTML and CSS -->
      <p>To begin with, let's have a look at what Javascript is, and how it relates to CSS and HTML:</p>
      <p>HTML5 (The latest HML) is comprised of three componenets, HTML, CSS and Javascript. It may be helpful to think of these like a car. A cars structure comes from its chassis, which in this case would be HTML. This defines the basic shape and purpose of the car.</p>

      <p>Then you have CSS which defines the style of the car. What shape is it? What color?</p>
      <p>And finally there is Javascript, allowing you to interact with the car, use the pedals to make it move and the steering wheel to make it turn, etc.</p>

    <!-- Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those). -->
    <p>Next we can look at Control Flow and Loops:</p>
    <p>Control Flow is the order in which functions are executed. An example of Control Flow that you may experience everyday is with the dishwasher.</p>
    <p>Are the dishes clean? - No - Run dishwashing loop. Are dishes clean? - Yes - Put dishes away.</p>
    <p>This leads in to Loops, and again we can use the dishes analogy.</p>
    <p>We may have multiple loads of dishes to put in the dishwasher, so we can call a loop to run (pack the dishwasher and then unload the dishwasher) until there are no dirty dishes left.</p>

    <!-- Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. -->
    <p>Onto the DOM (Document Object Model):</p>
    <p>The DOM allows programming languages to interact with the page. The DOM, itself, is not a programming language. But without it languages such as Javascript would not be able to interact with the webpage.</p>
    <p>You can directly interact with the DOM in order to grab specific elements, such as this sentence.</p>
    <p>Doing this allows us to make changes depending on user-input or add on functions. This also gives us the option to make changes to multiple or single elements.</p>
