      <!-- Analogy for JS relationship with HTML and CSS -->
      <p>To begin with, let's have a look at what Javascript is, and how it relates to CSS and HTML:</p>
      <p>HTML5 (The latest HML) is comprised of three componenets, HTML, CSS and Javascript. It may be helpful to think of these like a car. A cars structure comes from its chassis, which in this case would be HTML. This defines the basic shape and purpose of the car.</p>

      <p>Then you have CSS which defines the style of the car. What shape is it? What color?</p>
      <p>And finally there is Javascript, allowing you to interact with the car, use the pedals to make it move and the steering wheel to make it turn, etc.</p>

    <!-- Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those). -->
    <p>Next we can look at Control Flow and Loops:</p>
    <p>Control Flow is the order in which functions are executed. An example of Control Flow that you may experience everyday is with the dishwasher.</p>
    <p>Are the dishes clean? - No - Run dishwashing loop. Are dishes clean? - Yes - Put dishes away.</p>
    <p>This leads in to Loops, and again we can use the dishes analogy.</p>
    <p>We may have multiple loads of dishes to put in the dishwasher, so we can call a loop to run (pack the dishwasher and then unload the dishwasher) until there are no dirty dishes left.</p>

    <!-- Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. -->
    <p>Onto the DOM (Document Object Model):</p>
    <p>The DOM allows programming languages to interact with the page. The DOM, itself, is not a programming language. But without it languages such as Javascript would not be able to interact with the webpage.</p>
    <p>You can directly interact with the DOM in order to grab specific elements, such as this sentence.</p>
    <p>Doing this allows us to make changes depending on user-input or add on functions. This also gives us the option to make changes to multiple or single elements.</p>

<!-- Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. -->
    <p>Then we have Objects and Arrays:</p>
    <p>Both can be thought of as a container that holds a list of information.</p>
    <p>In an array that list can be accessed by finding the index value of the item you want to grab. The index value refers to where in the list the item is. Using this we can manipulate that value or use it elsewhere in our code. It should be noted that the first value of the index system will always be 0, and then count upwards from there.</p>
    <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/C-Arrays.jpg" alt="simple array">
    <p>We can see in the below image that objects work a little different. For this we need to use key names, to change or access the values in the list. The key acts like the index value in an array.</p>

<!-- Explain what functions are and why they are helpful. -->
    <p>Finally, we have functions:</p>
    <p>A function is essentially a list of commands we give the computer. By organising it into these lists (functions) we are able to use them when we want to repeat an action. This saves a ton of time, but also helps to better organise our code.</p>
    <p>In the below example we have the function name, the parameters (or input) and then the body which is the output.</p>
