      <li class="li-learning">What is your long term goal or career pathway?:</li>
      <p class="learning">I’m hoping to eventually get into game development. My shorter goal though would be to develop enough skills to get into the field. Then I can build experience and learning whilst working.</p>
      <li class="li-learning">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</li>
      <p class="learning">I think I’m good at breaking down problems and goals into manageable chunks, that I can then get out within a reasonable timeframe. If I finish early this makes it easy to improve sections. 
        I get distracted very easily. I think this is more of an issue during foundations as I’m working on my personal pc over the duration. I try to mitigate this though by taking breaks and setting myself goals for the day.</p>
     
      <li class="li-learning">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?:</li>
      <p class="learning">Broadly public speaking/working in a team. While I already think I work well in a team I definitely have trouble speaking with new people. I also think it’s worth always working on your problem solving which I imagine will be a big part of coding.</p>
      
      <li class="li-learning">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</li>
      <p class="learning">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
        To be productive and work well with others I think I need to set myself goals each day. I think limiting distractions at home by muting non-essential discord chats, etc, will help a lot.
        I think if things start to build up and I find myself getting frustrated I need to remember to take breaks, talk to friends and family, and if need be speak with facilitators to see if there is anything I can do to improve my workload.</p>
      
      <li class="li-learning">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</li>
      <p class="learning">I speak with my friends daily through discord which is a good way to vent any minor frustrations, but if I feel things building up I’ll make sure to speak with a facilitator and try to work with them to find a solution.</p>
      
      <li class="li-learning">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</li>
      <p class="learning">General help if we need it with code or issues with the course. Check-ins to see how things are going.</p>
      
      <li class="li-learning">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in:</li>
      <p class="learning">I think I only need an hour or two each day to spend with family/friends. I don’t currently have any continuing commitments outside of this, but would like to set aside maybe an hour or two for myself.</p>
