        <p>
          It becomes much easier to learn or improve skills if you know what you have to do to get there. It becomes a sort of guide on how to learn new things. This can be a huge motivator, especially as many of the principles may be demoralising. Knowing that new skills take time, and effort (intensity) means you are able to push out many of the common negative thoughts people face when attempting a new challenge.

        <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit:</h>
      </div>   
        <p>
          Use it or Lose it: Doing at least a little programming everyday.
          Use it and Improve it: Trying to do new things that build on what I already know.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specificity: Focus on the current activity / programming language / etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Repetition: Using the things I have learned and applying them to my website to make it interactive, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intensity: At least attempt all the stretch challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time: Not putting off my work, but instead taking short breaks. So I can be ‘fresh’ but still in the learning mind-set.
        </p>
        <p>
          Salience (importance): Understanding that everything we do on this course, the core and tech stuff, is important to building good habits and becoming a better programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Age: I’m doing this course pretty early into my career, I think anyone can learn and pick up new skills but it is much easier to reshape the brain in your early years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transference: Finding links to other things I do, to strengthen the learning I’m currently doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interference: Avoid bad coding habits. Trying to ‘soft code’, comment what I’m doing, etc.

        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity:</h>

          Eating healthy, Exercising, and Connecting with others. By building these good habits it will improve my overall physical and mental wellbeing and reduce distractions.

        <h3>Research Growth Mindset</h3>
        <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant:</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          Having a growth mindset means you are open to improving and learning new skills. It’s important to recognise that even if you aren’t at the skill level you want to be yet, you can improve and you aren’t trapped. Actually looking into a problem and trying to learn from your mistakes means that in the future you will be able to overcome bigger hurdles.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you:</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          Hearing how it would benefit to praise overcoming a challenge rather than just doing well. I think my own mindset changed while researching this topic. While I don’t think I was 100% in a fixed mindset, I definitely feel more open to facing challenges.
        </p>

      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey:</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          To integrate this, I’m going to try going that extra step if I finish a task early, like making my blog look nice, or doing the stretch exercise, etc. Rather than being content with achieving the basic goal.

        <p>
          I think I want to look at the areas I’m struggling in, or concepts I’m not 100% on yet and try to build my understanding of these. I’d like to be at least attempting all the stretch challenges to see what my skills are like and to improve my confidence and ability, if I’m not able to do them then it gives me a reason to do some research and build on my understanding.
