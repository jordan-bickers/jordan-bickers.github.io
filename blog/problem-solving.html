        <h3>A quick look at some problem solving techniques:</h>
      </div>
        <p>
          Pseudocode : Using Comments to break down a problem in small sections - Don’t include details, just a basic outline:
        </p>
        <p>
          The rubber ducky method : (Mild Insanity) In order to solve problems, or debug your code, it can be helpful to talk it through. For this you can use a rubber ducky and pretend it’s a colleague or friend, to voice your thoughts aloud and work through them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use console.log() : Console logging can be useful to see what your code is currently outputting, this can also identify errors in your code if your missing syntax, etc, console log will sometimes tell you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying something : Attempt a number of solutions and see what fits best. This can be helpful if you don’t have a clear direction or solution in mind. It is best to be willing to try solutions that may be unconventional as well so you have more possibilities. This is often used in design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improving your process with reflection. : It is important to reflect on what has worked. This way if you run into a similar problem in the future you may be able to more quickly overcome it. If a particular method has worked well, then it may be best to start with that method when attempting to solve a problem.
        </p>

        <h3>Speak about a time you were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
        <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          I had to create a function which took a string as an input. It would remove specific words from the string, regardless of capitalization. My problem was that the code kept giving me whitespace in random places.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          I wrote some pseudocode, and used console.log() a bunch. I could see what the issue was thanks to the testing code but I was having a lot of trouble trying to find a fix and so ended up just trying a bunch of stuff, moving and adding whitespace.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          It was super frustrating. I had code that would remove the keywords but it was either adding or removing too much whitespace. Being so close and not being able to get that final piece of the puzzle was super annoying.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          I way over complicated the issue and went down a rabbit hole with the first solution I thought I found. In the end with a little more research I found a method that was much better suited for the problem. I think I failed to recognise that I needed a break to clear my head, and obviously didn’t look around enough for a solution.

        <h3>Look at time you elegantly solved a problem:</h3>
        <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          I was trying to write a function which took a string as its input. It then needed to reverse this.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          Mostly pseudocode and the rubber-ducky methods. I used a little console logging as well to see what I was outputting.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          I was feeling pretty chill, even though the code I had written initially didn’t pass, I thought I had a good idea of the direction I needed to take and managed to reason through a solution.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>What did you learn?</h3>

        <p>
          It’s much easier to problem solve if you come at it with a calm head and give yourself direction / small tasks to complete that come together to solve the issue.

        <h3>Reflect on how confident you are with each problem-sovling technique / process</h3>
        <h3>Pseudocode:</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          I feel very confident with this method. I think I used this the most and even when I was able to solve a problem without it, I would often go back and comment on it so I would be able to look back later and know what I was thinking. Doing this made me confident I knew what each line of code was doing.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>Trying something:</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          I probably feel least comfortable with this method. I think it takes too long, but can yield results if I’m really lost or feel that I’ve exhausted my other options.

        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>Rubber ducky method:</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          This method was actually a lot more useful than I thought it would be, and I think I’m pretty confident with it. Being able to voice my thoughts helps me to clarify and organise them.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>Reading error messages:</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          This feels pretty 50/50 to me at the moment. I found it super useful for when I made a simple syntax error, but I didn’t find it very useful at giving me direction.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
          <h3>Console.logging:</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          I’m very comfortable with this. I sometimes used this even when my code passed so I could get a clear idea of what my code was actually doing. I think it helps me to picture what is actually happening.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>Googling:</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          I’m also fairly confident with this. If you make the issue broad enough you can often find a ton of resources that can give you heaps of different methods. Although for this reason it can also be helpful to narrow down your search if you already have an idea of the method you want to use.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>Asking your peers for help:</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          I feel comfortable doing this but often find I don’t need to. I’m usually able to google what I need fairly quickly, or take a break and come back to it. I don’t want to slow down, but I think it’s better if I can find the solution on my own because I’m often able to understand it better that way.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>Asking coaches for help:</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          I think I would also be comfortable doing this. Again I don’t think I’ve run into an issue yet where I need to, but I know if I get stuck for more than 15-20 min I can reach out on discord.
        </p>
      <div class="tinyHeader">
        <h3>Improving your process with reflection:</h3>
      </div>
        <p>
          I think I’m doing well with this as well. I’ve started using more pseudocode as I noticed a big improvement when I began to use it. Also the rubber ducky method, etc. I think I have been doing well to strengthen my ability to quickly problem solve and find solutions that work well.
